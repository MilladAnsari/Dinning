# Dinning-SBU visualisation in c++ language using Clui-library
This is my Fundamental_Programming course project about dinning platform visualisation and you can read more about details in /project/Itp-fall401-FinalProject.pdf and run the project to see and test this platform


## How to run 
1. Install Mingw/GCC on your system and add that to the path
2. Open a terminal and change the directory to clui/project folder 
3. Compile `cpp` code with `g++ project.cpp`

### library and sample codes are tested in Windows (MinGW) and Unix (GCC, clang) with C & C++ codes.
