# Clui
Simple cross-platform library for doing terminal things.

To learn more about functions, view `sample1.c` or `sample2.c`


## How to run 
1. Install Mingw/GCC on your system and add that to the path
2. Open a terminal and change the directory to clui folder 
3. Compile `c` code with `gcc sample1.c` or maybe you want to enable warning and debug mode: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -g sample1.c`
4. Compile `cpp` code with `g++ your_code.cpp`

### library and sample codes are tested in Windows (MinGW) and Unix (GCC, clang) with C & C++ codes.
